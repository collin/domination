This is me talking to myself, please ignore.

so like. 
you built the battle probability matrix. --done
it lets you rank match-ups of units.

you figured out which territories are yours and which ones actually CAN move. --done

Now you need to connect the two of them. --done

For a given hex ('q,r,s'),

what hexes are adjacent? --done
('q-1,r,s')
('q+1,r,s')
('q,r-1,s')
('q,r+1,s')
('q,r,s-1')
('q,r,s+1')
which of those can I attack? -- done
For each hex, hex exists
For each hex, playerId != myPlayerId

what is the probability of winning an attack? (probability 60% or higher) --done
For each hex combo (my hex to their hex),
battleMatrix[myHex.unit1][theirHex.unit1].ChanceToWin

which is the best attack? --done
Does it make sense to do that attack? Is it over some threshold? --done

What if there's no good attacks to make? Do you want to move? --Move or Do Nothing function
If you want to move, where should you move? 
--Where is the closest enemy? --Pathfinding function
--If there are multiple enemies at the same distance, which has the least units? --best enemy hex function
--Which hex should I move to in order to get closer to the enemy? --nextMove function
--from slack: 
'Moving units: If there are no good attacks to be made, the AI should move units closer to the nearest enemy hex with the least number of units
Step 1:  How many units can move?
Step 2: where are the closest enemy hexes?
Step 3: which of them have the least number of units?
Step 4: where do I move my units to get closer for the next battle?'
